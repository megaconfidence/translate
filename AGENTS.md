# Cloudflare Workers

STOP. Your knowledge of Cloudflare Workers APIs and limits may be outdated. Always retrieve current documentation before any Workers, KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects, Queues, Vectorize, AI, or Agents SDK task.

## Project invariant: the service worker shell

`public/sw.js` precaches the app shell. **Every module must be listed in `SHELL` in `sw.js`.** Miss one and an offline launch stalls on a failed import — the page loads and the app never starts. This failure is invisible online, so it will not show up in normal testing.

Whenever you add, rename, move, or delete a file under `public/js/` — or any other shell asset — do both of these:

1. Update the `SHELL` array in `public/sw.js`.
2. Bump `CACHE` (`translate-shell-vN` → `vN+1`). `activate` deletes every other cache, so clients pick up the new shell. Without the bump they keep serving the old one.

Check the two are in step:

```sh
ls -1 public/js/*.js | wc -l      # modules on disk
grep -c '"/js/' public/sw.js      # entries in SHELL
```

Verify offline behaviour after changing the shell: load the app, go offline, hard-reload, and confirm it still boots rather than hanging on a blank page.

`/api/*` is deliberately never cached — a translation is a one-shot paid response tied to a single photo, so a stale one would draw the wrong text over the right picture.

During development the service worker serves stale JavaScript. If an edit appears to have no effect, hard-reload or enable DevTools → Application → *Update on reload*.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npx wrangler dev` | Local development |
| `npx wrangler deploy` | Deploy to Cloudflare |
| `npx wrangler types` | Generate TypeScript types |

Run `wrangler types` after changing bindings in wrangler.jsonc.

## Local Explorer (Debugging & Inspection)

When running `npx wrangler dev`, a Local Explorer API is available for inspecting and debugging local Workers, bindings, and storage state. The API base URL is printed in the terminal when the dev server starts.

Key endpoints (relative to the dev server URL):

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/local/workers` | List local Workers and their bindings |
| `GET /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/storage/kv/namespaces` | List KV namespaces |
| `GET /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/d1/database` | List D1 databases |
| `GET /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/r2/buckets` | List R2 buckets |
| `GET /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/workers/durable_objects/namespaces` | List Durable Object namespaces |
| `GET /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/workflows` | List Workflows |
| `POST /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/local/observability/query` | Run a read-only SQL query (SELECT/WITH only) over captured request traces and console logs. Tables: `spans`, `logs` (read attributes via `json(attributes)`). Example: `curl -X POST <base>/cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/local/observability/query -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"sql":"SELECT service, name, outcome, duration_ms FROM spans WHERE parent_id IS NULL LIMIT 20"}'` |
| `POST /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/local/observability/clear` | Clear all captured traces and logs |

If the routes above don't cover what you need, fetch the full OpenAPI schema (large - use only as a last resort): `GET /cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api`

Use the Local Explorer to debug issues by inspecting storage state (KV keys, D1 rows, R2 objects, DO storage), viewing Worker bindings, and querying request traces and logs captured during the dev session.

## Best Practices (conditional)

If the application uses Durable Objects or Workflows, refer to the relevant best practices:

- Workflows: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/rules-of-workflows/
